                    <p>Indonesia is the biggest archipelagic (consisting of a chain of islands) country in the world.
                        The country is located in Southeast Asia and flanked on either side by the Indian Ocean and the
                        Pacific Ocean. It is comprised of 14,752 islands and islets, of which only 6,000 islands are
                        inhabited. It has a total land area of about 741,050 sq miles. Many of the islands are volcanic
                        in origin</p>

                    <h1>Eksplore</h1>
                    <h1>The Culture</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>The culture of Indonesia has been shaped by long interaction between original indiges customs and
                        multiple foreign influences. Indonesia is centrally-located along ancient trading routes between
                        the Far East, South Asia and the Middle East, resulting in many cultural practices being
                        strongly influenced by a multitude of religions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism,
                        Hinduism, and Islam, all strong in the major trading cities. The result is a complex cultural
                        mixture very different from the original indigenous cultures.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Examples of the fusion of Islam with Hinduism include Javanese Abangan belief. Balinese dances
                        have stories about ancient Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms, while Islamic art forms and architecture
                        are present in Sumatra, especially in the Minangkabau and Aceh regions. Traditional art, music
                        and sport are combined in a martial art form called Pencak Silat.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Western world has influenced Indonesia in science, technology and modern entertainment such
                        as television shows, film and music, as well as political system and issues. India has notably
                        influenced Indonesian songs and movies. A popular type of song is the Indian-rhythmical dangdut,
                        which is often mixed with Arab and Malay folk music.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Despite the influences of foreign culture, some remote Indonesian regions still preserve uniquely
                        indigenous culture. Indigenous ethnic groups Mentawai, Asmat, Dani, Dayak, Toraja and many
                        others are still practising their ethnic rituals, customs and wearing traditional clothes</p>

                <h1>Indonesia</h1>
                <h1>Where It's Located?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Indonesia is an archipelagic country located in Southeast Asia, lying between the Indian Ocean and
                    the Pacific Ocean. It is located in a strategic location astride or along major sea lanes connecting
                    East Asia, South Asia and Oceania. Indonesia is the largest archipelago in the world</p>
                <br>
                <p>Covering an area of 1,904,569 sq. km, and strategically positioned between the Pacific and Indian
                    Oceans, Indonesia comprises over 17,504 islands and is by far the largest and the most varied
                    archipelago on Earth. Of these islands, the larger islands of Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan (which
                    comprises two-thirds of the island of Borneo), Sulawesi, and Irian Jaya are quite mountainous, with
                    some peaks reaching 12,000 ft. These mountains on the major Indonesian Islands are densely forested
                    and volcanic in origin. The mountains with the highest elevations (over 16,000 ft) are found on
                    Irian Jaya in the east.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Located in the Papua province and as a part of the Sudirman mountain range is Puncak Jaya – the
                    highest point in Indonesia. At an elevation of 16,502 ft. (5,030 m) Puncak Jaya is also the world’s
                    highest island peak and the Southwestern Pacific’s tallest mountain. The lowest point is the Indian
                    Ocean (0m). Indonesia's former tallest peak, Mount Tambora (8,930 ft, 2,722 m), is an active
                    stratovolcano whose 1815 eruption was the largest ever in recorded history - killing nearly 71,000
                    people. The explosion alone was heard as far west as Sumatra island, some 1,200 miles (2,000 km)
                    away, and ashfalls were recorded on the islands of Borneo, Sulawesi, Java, and Maluku.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Due to its location along the south-western arm of the Ring of Fire, Indonesia has about 400
                    volcanoes within its borders, with at least 90 still active in some way. The most active volcanoes
                    are Mount Kelud (which has erupted more than 30 times since 1000 AD) and Mount Merapi (which has
                    erupted more than 80 times since 1000 AD) on Java island. For its location between numerous tectonic
                    plates, including the two continental plates: the Eurasian Plate (Sunda Shelf) and the Australian
                    Plate (Sahul Shelf), and two oceanic plates: the Philippine Sea Plate and Pacific Plate; natural
                    disasters are common in Indonesia.</p>
